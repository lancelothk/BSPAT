BSPAT
=====


BSPAT is a fast online service for analysing co-occurrence methylation patterns in bisulfite sequencing data. BSPAT integrated sequence mapping, quality control and visualized analysis result of co-occurrence DNA methylation patterns. Besides, it is much faster than existing tools which are based on multiple sequence alignment and pair-wise sequence alignment algorithms.
